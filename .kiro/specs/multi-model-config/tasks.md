# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement Backend Model Configuration System
  - Create `ModelConfigurationManager` class with methods for loading available models from providers
  - Implement `ProviderModelService` to fetch model information from OpenRouter and DeepSeek APIs
  - Add `CostCalculationService` to retrieve and calculate model costs per 1M tokens
  - Implement model filtering to show only models with function calling support
  - Extend existing `ConfigurationManager` to support per-agent model configuration in YAML format
  - Add validation service to verify model compatibility and availability
  - Create caching mechanism for model information and costs (1 hour TTL for models, 24 hours for costs)
  - Write unit tests for all backend services
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 2. Create GUI Multi-Model Configuration Panel
  - Design and implement `MultiModelConfigPanel` as new tab in existing GUI
  - Create `AgentModelSelector` widgets for each of 4 agents with dropdown model selection
  - Implement `ModelInfoWidget` to display model details (name, cost, capabilities, description)
  - Add `CostCalculatorWidget` showing real-time cost estimates for selected configuration
  - Create predefined configuration profiles: Budget, Balanced, Premium with appropriate model selections
  - Implement configuration save/load functionality with YAML file integration
  - Add configuration validation with user-friendly error messages
  - Integrate with existing GUI theme and styling system
  - Write GUI integration tests
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 3. Enhance TaskOrchestrator for Multi-Model Support
  - Modify `TaskOrchestrator.run_agent_parallel()` method to create agents with specific models per agent
  - Implement agent model configuration loading from YAML config file
  - Add logic to create `UniversalAgent` instances with different model configurations
  - Implement fallback to default model when agent-specific model is not configured
  - Add logging of which model each agent uses during execution
  - Create cost tracking and reporting for actual token usage per agent
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing single-model configurations
  - Add error handling for model-specific failures with graceful degradation
  - Write integration tests for multi-model orchestration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 7.2, 7.3_

- [x] 4. Implement Advanced Features and Testing
  - Add configuration testing functionality that validates each configured model with test API calls
  - Implement configuration export/import feature with JSON format and API key sanitization
  - Create configuration comparison tool showing cost differences between setups
  - Add real-time cost monitoring and budget alerts during multi-agent execution
  - Implement configuration profiles management (save custom profiles, share between users)
  - Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and recovery suggestions
  - Create end-to-end tests covering complete user workflows from GUI to orchestrator
  - Add performance monitoring and optimization for GUI responsiveness
  - Write user documentation and configuration examples
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.4, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 5.3, 5.4_
